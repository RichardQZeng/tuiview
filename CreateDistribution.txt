How to create a distribution of TuiView. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the tuiview/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Use "hg tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    hg tag tuiview-1.1.9
4. Create the distribution tarball, using
    TUIVIEW_INCLUDEBAT=1 python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
   This also ensures that the .bat files needed on Windows are included
   when creating the tarball on Linux.
5. Upload these to bitbucket, under the downloads tab. 


Version Numbers.
The TuiView number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
